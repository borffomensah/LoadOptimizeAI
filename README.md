# WORKLOAD-FORECASTER
This project focuses on building a time series forecasting model to predict future workload based on historical data. Workload forecasting is critical for resource planning, capacity management, and optimizing operational efficiency in various domains such as IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and workforce management.
The project leverages time series analysis and machine learning techniques to create accurate and reliable forecasts. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help organizations anticipate workload demands and allocate resources effectively.

# Key Features

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical workload data, including timestamps and corresponding workload metrics. The data is collected at regular intervals (weekly).

# Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Handled missing values and outliers.

Resampled data to ensure consistent time intervals.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed trends, seasonality, and stationarity.

Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Model Selection and Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train multiple time series models and tune hyperparameters.

# Model Evaluation:

Compare model performance using evaluation metrics.

Select the best-performing model for forecasting.

Forecasting and Visualization:

Generate workload forecasts for future time periods.

Visualize results using interactive plots.

# Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of time series models in predicting workload trends. The best-performing model achieved an RMSE of 10350.16 and MAE of 7793.57, indicating high accuracy in forecasting. The results can be used to optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency.
