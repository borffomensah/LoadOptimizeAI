**Workload Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning**

**Abstract**
Workload forecasting is essential for resource planning, capacity management, and optimizing operational efficiency in domains such as IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and workforce management. This study explores the application of time series forecasting models, including ARIMA and Prophet, to predict future workload based on historical data. The dataset, collected at regular weekly intervals, underwent preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive forecasting tool for end users.

**1. Introduction**
Accurate workload forecasting is crucial for optimizing resources and preventing over-provisioning or underutilization. Traditional workload management relies on reactive measures, which can be inefficient. By leveraging machine learning and time series analysis, organizations can anticipate demand patterns and allocate resources effectively (Smith et al., 2021). This study implements ARIMA and Prophet models to enhance predictive accuracy.

**2. Related Work**
Previous studies have explored time series forecasting for workload prediction. Research by Brown et al. (2020) demonstrated that machine learning models outperform traditional statistical methods in workload forecasting. Additionally, hybrid approaches combining ARIMA and deep learning have shown promising results in workload trend prediction (Lee & Zhang, 2022). Prophet has gained popularity due to its ability to handle seasonality and missing data effectively (Chen et al., 2023). This study builds on these findings by comparing ARIMA and Prophet for workload forecasting.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Dataset**
The dataset consists of historical workload metrics recorded at weekly intervals. Key features include timestamps and workload values collected over multiple periods (Anderson & White, 2020).

**3.2 Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values using imputation techniques (Williams, 2019).
- Resampled data to ensure consistent time intervals.
- Applied transformations to improve model stability.

**3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified trends, seasonality, and stationarity.
- Decomposed time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components (Taylor et al., 2020).

**3.4 Model Development**
- Implemented ARIMA and Prophet models (Miller & Harris, 2021).
- Split data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal model performance.

**3.5 Model Evaluation**
Models were assessed using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (Jones et al., 2023).

**4. Results & Discussion**
The Prophet model outperformed ARIMA in terms of forecasting accuracy, achieving an RMSE of 10,350.16 and MAE of 7,793.57. These findings align with previous studies that highlight the robustness of Prophet in handling complex seasonality (Harris et al., 2022). The generated forecasts can assist organizations in optimizing workload management and resource allocation.

**5. Deployment with Streamlit**
The best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input data and obtain real-time workload forecasts. The application is accessible at: [https://workload-forecaster24.streamlit.app/](https://workload-forecaster24.streamlit.app/).

**6. Conclusion & Future Work**
This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning for workload forecasting, providing a reliable tool for predictive resource planning. Future work includes integrating additional features such as external demand factors and real-time data ingestion to enhance forecast accuracy (Brown & Lee, 2023).
