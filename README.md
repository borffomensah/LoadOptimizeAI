# WORKLOAD-FORECASTER
This project focused on building a time series forecasting model to predict future workload based on historical data. Workload forecasting is critical for resource planning, capacity management, and optimizing operational efficiency in various domains such as IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and workforce management.
The project leveraged time series analysis and machine learning techniques to create accurate and reliable forecasts. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help organizations anticipate workload demands and allocate resources effectively.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, resampling, and transforming raw workload data into a suitable format for time series analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, seasonality, and patterns in the workload data.

3. Model Development: Implemented and compared multiple time series models, including ARIMA and Prophet

4. Model Evaluation: Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.

5. Forecasting: Generated short-term and long-term workload predictions (Weekly,Monthly,Quaterly and Yearly).

6. Visualization: Interactive plots and dashboards to present forecasted results.

# Technologies Used

# Dataset
1. The dataset used in this project consists of historical workload data, including timestamps and corresponding workload metrics. The data is collected at regular intervals (weekly).

# Methodology
# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

2. Handled missing values and outliers.

3.Resampled data to ensure consistent time intervals.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1.Analyzed trends, seasonality, and stationarity.

2.Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

# Model Selection and Training:

1. Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Trained multiple time series models and tune hyperparameters.

# Model Evaluation:

1. Compared model performance using evaluation metrics.

2. Selected the best-performing model for forecasting.

# Forecasting and Visualization:

1. Generated workload forecasts for future time periods.

2. Visualized results using interactive plots.

# Results
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of time series models in predicting workload trends. The best-performing model achieved an RMSE of 10350.16 and MAE of 7793.57, indicating high accuracy in forecasting. The results can be used to optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency.
# Deployment 
The model was then deployed on streamlit for end users experience.Attached is the link to the streamlit app
